# GyroTrolley

Project created for the BAIT 2016 hackathon (organised by [BEST](http://www.best.krakow.pl/)).

Endless-runner-like game created in the Unity engine. You control the direction (not lane!) in which a character moves with moves of your body. While the game itself is for a PC, it is controlled by movements of a smartphone.

Project created with [zdzarsky](https://github.com/zdzarsky), [pwamej](https://github.com/pwamej) and [Shino1024](https://github.com/Shino1024).
